## Definitions
Every day, experts at AWS assist customers in architecting systems to take advantage of
best practices in the cloud. We work with you on making architectural trade-offs as your
designs evolve. As you deploy these systems into live environments, we learn how well these
systems perform and the consequences of those trade-offs.
Based on what we have learned, we have created the AWS
Well-Architected Framework, which provides a consistent set of
best practices for customers and partners to evaluate
architectures, and provides a set of questions you can use to
evaluate how well an architecture is aligned to AWS best
practices.
The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars —
operational excellence, security, reliability, performance
efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.
Table 1. The pillars of the AWS
Well-Architected Framework
Name
Description
Operational excellence
The ability to support development and run workloads
effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to
continuously improve supporting processes and procedures
to deliver business value.
Security
The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to
protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security
posture.
Reliability
The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its
intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. This includes the
ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper
provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS.
Performance efficiency
The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet
system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as
demand changes and technologies evolve.
Cost optimization
The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the
lowest price point.
Sustainability
The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.
In the AWS Well-Architected Framework, we use these terms:
A component is the code,
configuration, and AWS Resources that together deliver against a
requirement. A component is often the unit of technical
ownership, and is decoupled from other components.
The term workload is used to
identify a set of components that together deliver business
value. A workload is usually the level of detail that business
and technology leaders communicate about.
We think about architecture
as being how components work together in a workload. How
components communicate and interact is often the focus of
architecture diagrams.
Milestones mark key changes in your architecture as it
evolves throughout the product lifecycle (design, implementation, testing, go live, and in
production).
Within an organization the technology
portfolio is the collection of workloads that are
required for the business to operate.
The level of effort is categorizing the amount of
time, effort, and complexity a task requires for implementation. Each organization needs
to consider the size and expertise of the team and the complexity of the workload for
additional context to properly categorize the level of effort for the
organization.
High: The work might take multiple weeks or
multiple months. This could be broken out into multiple stories, releases, and
tasks.
Medium: The work might take multiple days or
multiple weeks. This could be broken out into multiple releases and tasks.
Low: The work might take multiple hours or
multiple days. This could be broken out into multiple tasks.
When architecting workloads, you make trade-offs between pillars based on your business
context. These business decisions can drive your engineering priorities. You might optimize to improve sustainability impact and reduce cost at the expense of reliability in development environments, or, for mission-critical solutions, you might optimize reliability with increased costs and sustainability impact. In ecommerce
solutions, performance can affect revenue and customer propensity to buy. Security and
operational excellence are generally not traded-off against the other pillars.
